## The Contributing Guide

Hey!

If you would like to add/improve something at `vator` project - feel free to do it! ðŸš€

Just follow simple guideline:

1.  Create an `issue` with description about what needs to be done.

2.  Create a `pull request` which will be related to this `issue`.

3.  Please keep in mind that `test coverage` requires to be at least 99%.
    It is not necessary to write all of the unit tests. A few integration,
    which check how the feature works and cover all new code will be just great!

4.  Also add new or update existing documentation, if new feature was added or
    some fixes change the behavior of edited module.

5.  If you are new contributor - don't forget to add your info to `package.json`
    contributors and to the edited/created file's license header.

6.  Before creating a `commit` - make sure `npm run hooks` was executed and
    `commit-message` and `pre-commit` hooks are working. The project is set up
    with a requirement to **manually** update semantic version, so don't forget
    to update it at the `package.json` version.

7.  Once all PR requirements are met (review, resolved comments, ci-workflow pass) it
    is ready be merged! ðŸ˜Ž
